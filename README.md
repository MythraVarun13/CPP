# Vectors and Pointers Basic Demo

`reverseUsingPointers` folder, contains a program that reverses an array using pointers. The program first defines a function called `swap` that swaps the values of two memory locations. The `swap` function is then used in a second function called `reverse` to reverse the order of the elements in the array. The program then prints the original and reversed arrays to the console.

`reverseVectorArray` folder, contains a program that reverses a vector of pointers. The program first defines a vector of int pointers. The program then prompts the user to enter the size of the vector and to enter the values of the elements in the vector. The program then uses a loop to reverse the order of the elements in the vector. The program then prints the original and reversed vectors to the console.

`vectors` folder , contains a program that demonstrates how to use vectors in C++. The program first defines a vector of int pointers. The program then prompts the user to enter the size of the vector and to enter the values of the elements in the vector. The program then prints the values of the vector to the console. The program then deletes the dynamically allocated memory for the vector.

To run the code, you can compile it using the following command:
​
``` g++ -o main main.cpp ```
​
This will create an executable file called "main". You can then run the executable file by typing the following command:

``` ./main ```./main

I hope this helps you understand the code. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
